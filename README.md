# GHOSTs Tasks
This is a simple webapp that you can use to keep track of tasks! It is based on sending webhooks, you can access it here: https://tasks.ghostdev.xyz

# Privacy
Everything runs locally on your device, there are no servers. This does mean you can't sync tasks between devices however this is done so there is no cost to running the app nor any potential privacy concerns.

Webhooks you add are your responsibility to secure, I'd recommend creating a Discord server only you have access to.
